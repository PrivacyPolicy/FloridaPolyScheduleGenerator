Students will learn fundamental programming concepts and systematic design techniques. They will use them to write programs that computationally solve and reduce problems. At the end of the course, students will be able to use a programming language without focusing on the language specifics. No prior programming background is required and a working knowledge of high school level algebra is expected. This course is a prerequisite for all subsequent programming courses and is designed for all majors at both colleges.",
